Projects are geared toward those typically found in the information systems field.‚Äù 3 credits. Prerequisite: IS 101 recommended (from catalog). This course is an introduction to both programming and the principles of computer science. You will learn how to program with principles that are relevant to all programming languages and also learn the basic concepts and vocabulary of computer science. It is a very important course in your education and will require significant weekly work on the readings and the programming projects. It will give you the concepts that will make your future IS courses easier and give you a valuable programming skill that you can use in future courses. This course serves as preparation for IS 247.
